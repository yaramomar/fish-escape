# Fish Escape - C++ Game

Welcome to **Fish Escape**, a simple yet engaging C++ game where you play as a fish trying to survive in the ocean while avoiding attacking sea creatures. The game features basic gameplay mechanics where you, the fish, must evade enemies for as long as possible. The game is coded in C++ and designed to be simple, yet demonstrate key concepts such as object-oriented programming, game logic, and handling interactions between different game entities.

## Features

- **Player-Controlled Fish**: Control the main character, a fish, as it swims around the ocean.
- **Enemy Creatures**: Multiple creatures are trying to attack the fish, providing a dynamic and challenging experience.
- **Game Logic**: Advanced logic handles various scenarios like collision detection, movement, and game-over conditions.
- **Simple, Lightweight Design**: The code is easy to read and modify, making it a great project for beginners to learn C++ game development.


## Code Structure

The project is composed of several C++ source and header files to manage different parts of the game:

- **main.cpp**: Entry point of the game, responsible for initializing the game loop.
- **fish.cpp / fish.h**: Defines the player's fish character, its movement, and behavior.

## Game Logic

The game logic is designed to handle several scenarios:

- **Collision Detection**: When the fish collides with an enemy, the game ends.
- **Movement**: Both the player and enemies move within the game world. The enemies follow a basic AI to attack the fish.
- **Scoring**: The longer the fish survives, the higher the score.
